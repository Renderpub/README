# README

Renderpub is a small, talented team of developers and designers building 3D content creation tools and a photorealistic metaverse platform for experiencing architectural spaces socially. We are completely bootstrapped and now looking to raise funds.
 
To build a better looking, better serving metaverse, we need to equip the right kind of people with the right kind of tools. We believe architects are uniquely positioned to build the metaverse because they have a clear understanding of the form and function of spaces and are able to clearly define interactions between spaces and their users. Renderpub Studio is an easy to use VR & 3D content creation tool for architectural use cases which black boxes the complexities of optimizing photorealistic 3D content for use on the web.
 
Renderpub has 2 key offerings:
1) an open-source, decentralized, photorealistic metaverse platform called "Renderpub Spaces"
2) a content creation tool to build the metaverse called "Renderpub Studio"
 
Renderpub Studio:
Over the last 3 years we have collaborated with many architects and experts in the field to build and perfect Renderpub Studio which will be ready for beta launch in about a month.
Key features:
1) Architectural Modeling
2) Realtime Ray-Traced Rendering
3) 3D Asset Libraries
4) One-Click export of highly optimized and compressed VR assets(Spaces) onto Renderpub Spaces and other metaverse platforms.
